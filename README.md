# The NLU Bubble Application

Welcome to the Watson Natural Language Understanding (NLU) Hands-On THINK lab! This application demonstrates how to use NLU with the [`node.js` SDK](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/node-sdk) to extract interesting structured data from your documents!

## Getting Started

### Dev Environment

To get started with the app, you can use the Node Version Manager (`nvm`) to configure your `node.js` development environment.

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
nvm install
```

With this complete, you should have node `10.14.2` installed

```sh
node --version
v10.14.2
```

### Install Dependencies

To install all of the necessary dependencies, run the following:

```sh
npm install
```

### Start the App

To boot up the app on port `3000`, run the following:

```sh
npm start
```

### Use It

To use the running app, load [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) in your browser.
